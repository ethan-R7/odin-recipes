    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
    
    <p>
    Prepare all your vegetables, blanch the spinach and bean sprouts, and sauté the carrots, cucumber, and shiitake mushrooms separately. Season each with a pinch of salt and set aside.
    <br><br>
    In a small bowl, mix all the ingredients for the Bibimbap sauce (Gochujang Sauce). Adjust the seasoning to taste. Set aside.
    <br><br>
    Marinate the beef by combining all the marinade ingredients in a bowl and mixing well. Let it sit for about 10-15 minutes.
    <br><br>
    Heat a pan over medium-high heat and add a bit of vegetable oil. Sauté the marinated beef until it's cooked through. Set aside.
    <br><br>
    In the same pan, fry the eggs sunny-side up or to your preferred doneness. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.
    <br><br>
    To assemble the Bibimbap bowls, start with a serving of cooked rice at the bottom of each bowl.
    <br><br>
    Arrange the sautéed vegetables, cooked beef, and fried egg on top of the rice in separate sections to create a visually appealing presentation.
    <br><br>
    Drizzle some sesame oil over the top and sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds.
    <br><br>
    Serve the Bibimbap with the Gochujang sauce on the side, allowing diners to add sauce to taste. Encourage them to mix everything together before eating to enjoy the full flavors of Bibimbap.
    <br><br>
    Feel free to customize your Bibimbap with other vegetables or protein sources that you like. It's a versatile dish that can be adapted to your preferences. Enjoy your homemade Bibimbap!

        <li>Vegetable oil (for frying eggs)</li>

    </ul>
    
    <h4>For the Chips (Fries)::</h4>
    <ul> 
        <li>4 large russet potatoes</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
    
    <p>
    Peel the potatoes and cut them into thick, uniform strips, about 1/2 inch wide.
    <br><br>
    Rinse the potato strips under cold water to remove excess starch, then pat them dry with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels.
    <br><br>
    Heat a large pot or deep fryer with vegetable oil to 325-350°F (163-177°C).
    <br><br>
    Carefully add the potato strips in batches to avoid overcrowding the oil. Fry for about 4-6 minutes or until they are lightly golden and starting to crisp up. Remove the fries with a slotted spoon and drain them on paper towels.
    <br><br>
    Increase the oil temperature to 375°F (190°C).
    <br><br>
    Return the partially fried potato strips to the hot oil in batches and fry for another 2-4 minutes or until they are golden brown and crispy. Remove them again and drain on paper towels. Season with salt immediately.
    <br><br>
    In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and black pepper.
    <br><br>
    Gradually whisk in the cold sparkling water (or cold beer) until you have a smooth batter. The batter should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon but not too thick.
    <br><br>
    Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or large heavy-bottomed pan to 350-375°F (177-190°C).
    <br><br>
    Dip each fish fillet into the batter, allowing any excess to drip off.
    <br><br>
    Carefully place the battered fish fillets into the hot oil. Fry for about 5-7 minutes or until they are golden brown and the fish is cooked through. The cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of your fillets.
    <br><br>
    Remove the fried fish using a slotted spoon and drain them on a paper towel-lined plate.

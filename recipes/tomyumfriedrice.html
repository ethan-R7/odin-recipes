        Tom Yum Fried Rice is a flavorful Thai dish that combines the bold and tangy flavors of Tom Yum soup with the comfort of fried rice.</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <h4>For the Bibimbap Sauce (Gochujang Sauce):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups cooked jasmine rice (preferably cold and day-old)</li>
        <li>200g (7 oz) shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>200g (7 oz) chicken breast, thinly sliced (optional)</li>
        <li>2-3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2-3 bird's eye chili peppers, finely chopped (adjust to your spice preference)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Tom Yum paste (adjust to taste)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
    
    <p>
    Prepare your ingredients, ensuring the rice is cold and separated.
    <br><br>
    If using chicken, slice it thinly and marinate in soy sauce for 10-15 minutes. Combine fish sauce, soy sauce, sugar, and lime juice in a small bowl to make a sauce.
    <br><br>
    Heat a large wok or skillet over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of oil. Stir-fry the chicken until no longer pink; then remove and set aside. Add another tablespoon of oil and cook the shrimp until pink and opaque; remove and set aside.
    <br><br>
    In the same pan, add minced garlic and bird's eye chili peppers. Stir-fry for about 30 seconds until fragrant. Add chopped onion and bell peppers, and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until vegetables begin to soften.
    <br><br>
    Push vegetables to one side and add Tom Yum paste to the other side. Stir for about a minute to release flavor.
    <br><br>
    Add cold, cooked rice to the pan and stir-fry to combine with vegetables and Tom Yum paste.
    <br><br>
    Pour the prepared sauce over the rice and stir to evenly distribute the flavors. Add cherry tomatoes, frozen peas, cooked chicken (if using), and cooked shrimp. Continue to stir-fry until everything is heated through.
    <br><br>
    Taste and adjust seasoning with more fish sauce, soy sauce, or Tom Yum paste as needed.
    <br><br>
    Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves and serve with lime wedges on the side. Enjoy your homemade Tom Yum Fried Rice with its bold and tangy Thai flavors!
